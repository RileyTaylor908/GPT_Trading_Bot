2024-08-09 11:03:08,261 - INFO - Prediction: Prediction: Buy

Reasoning: The data shows an overall bearish trend from late July into early August, with substantial downward movements around August 5th and 6th. However, there seems to be a slight recovery in the market from August 7th to August 9th, with prices moving from $209.810 to $214.660. Additionally, trading volume has been fluctuating but shows considerable activity, particularly on August 8th and 9th.

The recent closing price increased significantly from the low on August 5th, suggesting a potential reversal or at least a short-term upward trend. The VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) for the last day is closer to the closing price, which reinforces the idea of a stable or slightly bullish market condition. Therefore, it might be a good opportunity to buy, expecting continued recovery or positive momentum.
